Our 4th annual workshop took place on June 11, 2021 in virtual space. Based on the feedback from the participants in this keynote event, we organized two follow-up workshops in September providing a more detailed overview of the benchmarking practices and results, and bespoke fitting infrastructure.

### **1. Benchmarking** (Sep 1, 2021)

The first follow-up workshop provided an overview of the methods used for the Season 1 of benchmarking and analysis of results from the private and public sets, and summarized progress on protein-ligand benchmarking. The first half of the workshop included a classical presentation, and the second half was an interactive demo following the prepared jupyter notebook, with some time spent on Q&A and discussions. This workshop was led by Lorenzo D'Amore and the benchmarking team.
